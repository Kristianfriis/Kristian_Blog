    text: 'The first course I took was called programming. I call the blog post for simple programming because it would be more fitting. The course itself is just called “Programming”, but I suspect it is called that because it looks better than “Simple Programming” or “Programming Fundamentals”.'
          + '<br>' + '<br>' +
          'It was a 7 week course where we were taught taught fundamental programming in Javascript, which makes a lot of sense considering it is really easy to get started with Javascript. You only need a browser and a text editor then you are good to go.'
           + '<br>' + '<br>' +
          'Having already finished almost all of FreeCodeCamps Javascript section, I did not find the course hard or difficult. I did learn some new things which was nice and finally got my head wrapped around multi dimensional arrays.'

          'For my exam project I made a simple website that would take the length, width, height and weight of up to 10 different parcels/pallets and would output which carrier service had surcharges on the input and what kind of surcharges. The main things I took away from this project was:'
          + '<br>' + '<br>' +
          'Loops: Before this project I used to just hardcode things instead of creating a loop and loop through them. This was a huge timesaver, and cleared up all the many lines of code that did the same thing. It also helped with the readability of my code. So I learned how DRY should be a part of your mindset when programming.'

          'Multidimensional Arrays: Really simple actually, I just learned and understood how multidimensional arrays work.'
          + '<br>' + '<br>' +
          'Structure: The way I structured this project, which was my first larger project, was just in one .js file which is a horrible way to do it. Since then I have reminded myself over and over to separate files and code in a module like way. This has helped a lot when reading my code later and not get super confused.',

    title: 'Second Course: Databases',
    text: 'The Second course was a 10 week course in databases. We had our focus on Microsoft SQL server and the thoughts that go into designing and building a database.' + '<br>' +
          'The course was estimated to take 10 weeks to complete, but you had 6 months to complete these 10 weeks.'  + '<br>' +
          'That proved to be hard for me, as I did literally nothing the first 10 weeks of the course. I learned that I need a close deadline to complete a project otherwise I will procrastinate.But hey, It is good to learn these things about one self. For instance, I now know I have to set small deadlines within a big project, else I will procrastinate.'
           + '<br>' + '<br>' +
          'The topic I found the hardest to understand in the course was ER diagrams. It was to abstract and designy (though it is not a word). So this way of designing a database is not my favourite kind.'  + '<br>' +
          'But Database Normalization on the other hand, that I do get, and I like it. It is more tangible than ER diagrams.'

    title: 'Third Course: Client Side Programming',
    text: 'This time it was client side programming. This included HTML, CSS and Javascript. So I was right at home, having completed all of the frontend portion of FreeCodeCamp I felt confident that I would ace this course.<br><br>And I did, nothing more to say than that. I created a website for my dad’s fictional company, where he might sell custom grips made for pistols. It went pretty well if I say so myself. I am no designer and my website suffers from that, but technically it is           proficient.<br><br> From this I got more confidence in making websites and tried some new things like creating modals and picture carousels. This is something I can use in my future endeavours.<br><br> I have some projects lined up for a client. It is a hairdresser who do not have a website at the moment. So it is gonna be a simple one page application, with a future time booking feature since the next course I am gonna take is server side programming.',
